Enchanting Plus is a mod that gives players a greater degree of control over enchanting their items. This source repository contains the code for MC 1.5.2 to 1.12.2 and is no longer being updated. While the project has taken a long hiatus there are still active plans to bring this mod into modern versions of the game. Future updates and announcements will be posted to the project on CurseForge.
